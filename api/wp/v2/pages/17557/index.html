Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website, and to identify users returning to a website. Cookies may be either \u201cpersistent\u201d cookies or \u201csession\u201d cookies. A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"cookies-on-this-website\">Cookies on this website<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We use both session cookies and persistent cookies on this website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-we-use-cookies\">How we use cookies<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cookies do not contain any information that personally identifies you, but personal information that we store about you may be linked, by us, to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
